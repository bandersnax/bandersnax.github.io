title: is this thing on?
---

I've thought about doing something like this for a long time, but couldn't ever convince myself that 
I'd do it with any regularity.  I'm honestly still not 100% sure that I will, but I'd like to put something 
out there, even if it's just for me.

In terms of content I'll probably be speaking mostly about tech focused with some personal topics interspersed 
every now & again.  I've been working with a lot of open source software - going so far as to convert my daily driver
to Arch Linux from Windows - the last Windows device in the house - and I'd like to share some of the things I've 
learned in a way that could even help someone who doesn't consider themselves technically proficient.

I've always had an interest in open source software, but there's 3 main things that have really pushed me in this direction:

1. A desire to be more informed about how my use of hardware affects the environment.
2. Becoming increasingly aware of how much & how many companies make a profit off of my information in exchange for using their proprietary services.
3. I just enjoy gadgets & tinkering!

I'll share these out with onto my social media pages so anyone interested in reading them can - not expecting many will but still excited to share what I know with the people I enjoy being around.

See y'all around
